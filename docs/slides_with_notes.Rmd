Workshop aims
=============

1. Implement basic steps of a genome-wide association analysis.

2. Understand how phenotype and genotype data for a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) are encoded in computer files.

3. Understand some of the benefits (and complications) of using
linear-mixed models (LMMs) for GWAS.

4. Use command-line tools to inspect and manipulate phenotype and
genotype data.

Workshop aims
=============

+ This is a *hands-on workshop*---you will get the most out of this
  workshop if you work through the exercises on your computer.

+ The examples are intended to run either on the RCC cluster or on
  a laptop with Linux or macOS (not Windows).

+ About 15 GB will be needed to store all the the data and output files.

+ *Note: the examples may not produce the exact same result on your
  laptop. Using the RCC cluster is recommended.*

Software we will use today
==========================

1. GEMMA

2. R

3. Several R packages: data.table, ggplot2, cowplot and stringr.

4. Basic shell commands such as "cat" and "wc".

Our research task
=================

Identify and interpret genetic loci contributing to tibia bone
development in mice.

1. We will use data from this study:

    - Nicod *et al* (2016). "Genome-wide association of multiple
      complex traits in outbred mice by ultra-low-coverage
      sequencing." *Nature Genetics* **48:** 912--918.

2. To map tibia development genes, we will assess support (*p*-values)
for statistical association between tibia length and 353,697 SNP
genotypes.

3. We will visualize the association signal to identify candidate
genes for tibia bone development.

Background on study
===================

+ Samples are from an outbred mouse population, "Carworth Farms White"
(CFW).

+ 200 measurements (blood concentrations, muscle weights, *etc*) were
taken for each mouse.

+ Genotypes were obtained from low-coverage DNA sequencing.

+ Size of data is comparable to human GWAS: 2,000 samples,
350,000 SNPs.

+ Linkage disequilibrium (LD) does not decay as rapidly as humans, so
mapping resolution will not be as good as a human GWAS.

+ Data are publicly available.

Outline of workshop
===================

+ **Preliminaries**

+ Programming challenges:

    1. Setting up your environment for an association analysis.

    2. Preparing the data for an association analysis.

Challenge #1: Setting up your environment for GWAS
==================================================

+ Aim: Configure your computing environment for the next programming
  challenges.

+ Steps:

    1. Connect to midway2.*

    2. Clone git repository.*

    3. Download genotype data.

    4. Download GEMMA.

    3. Connect to a midway2 compute node.*

    4. Launch R, and check your R environment.

    5. Set up R for plotting.

Connect to midway2
==================

+ **If you have an RCC account:** I'm assuming you already know how to
  connect to midway2. *ThinLinc is recommended if you do not know how
  activate X11 forwarding in SSH.*

    + See: rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/connecting

+ **If you do not have an RCC account:** I can provide you with a
  Yubikey. This will give you guest access to the RCC cluster (see the
  next slide).

Using the Yubikeys
==================

+ Prerequisites:

    1. SSH client (for Windows, please use **MobaXterm**)

    2. USB-A port

+ Steps:

    1. Insert Yubikey into USB port.

    2. Note your userid: `rccguestXXXX`, where `XXXX` is the
       last four digits shown on Yubikey.

    3. Follow instructions to connect to midway2 via SSH, replacing
       the cnetid with your `rccguestXXXX` user name:
       rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/connecting

    4. When prompted for password, press lightly on metal disc.

+ Important notes:

    - Yubikeys do not work with ThinLinc.

    - *Please return the Yubikey at the end of the workshop.*

Clone git repository
====================

Clone the workshop packet in your home directory on midway2 (**note:**
there are no spaces in the URL below):

```{bash download-packet, eval=FALSE}
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/
  genetic-data-analysis-2.git
cd genetic-data-analysis-2
```

Download genotype data
======================

The genotype data are too large to fit in the git repository. So we
need to download these data separately.

+ Go to: http://mtweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/dosages

+ Download files for chromosomes 1--19.

+ You may find it easier to run the provided bash script:

    ```{bash download-genotypes, eval=FALSE}
    bash download_genotypes.sh
    ```

+ After following these steps, you should have a total of 19 files
  with extension ".RData" in the "genetic-data-analysis-2" folder.

Alternatively, download the prepared data (faster):

```{bash download-genotypes-midway2, eval=FALSE}
wget users.rcc.uchicago.edu/~pcarbo/cfwgeno.tar.gz
tar zxvf cfwgeno.tar.gz
```

Download GEMMA
==============

Download GEMMA 0.96. Go to:

+ https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA/releases/tag/v0.96

On midway2, you can run these commands to download and install GEMMA
0.96 for Linux:

```{bash get-gemma, eval=FALSE}
wget http://bit.ly/2I67fBV -O gemma.linux.gz
gunzip gemma.linux.gz
mv gemma.linux gemma
chmod 700 gemma
./gemma -h
```

Connect to a midway2 compute node
=================================

Set up an interactive session on a midway2 compute node with 4 CPUs
and 10 GB of memory:

```{bash connect-midway2, eval=FALSE}
screen -S workshop
sinteractive --partition=broadwl \
  --reservation=workshop --cpus-per-task=4 \
  --mem=10G --time=3:00:00
echo $HOSTNAME
```

Launch R
========

Start up an interactive R session. On midway2, you can start up R with
these commands:

```{bash start-R, eval=FALSE}
module load R/3.6.1
which R
R --no-save
```

*Note: You can use R or RStudio.*

Check your R environment
========================

Check the version of R you are running:

```{r check-version}
sessionInfo()
```

Check that you are starting with an empty environment:

```{r check-environment}
ls()
```

Check that you have the correct working directory---it should be set
to the "genetic-data-analysis-2" repository:

```{r check-wd}
getwd()
```

> Instructor notes: If `ls()` does not return `character(0)`, clear
> your environment by running `rm(list = ls())`.

Set up R for plotting
=====================

Make sure you can display graphics in your current R session.

```{r plot-cars}
library(ggplot2)
data(cars)
quickplot(cars$dist,cars$speed)
```

You should see a scatterplot. If not, your connection is not set up to
display graphics. On midway2, an alternative is to save the plot to a
file, and download the file to your computer using sftp or SAMBA. See:

+ rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/data-transfer

Quit R
======

We will quit R, and return to it later.

```{r quit, eval=FALSE}
quit()
```

Outline of workshop
===================

+ Preliminaries

+ Programming challenges:

    1. Setting up your environment for an association analysis.

    2. **Preparing the data for an association analysis.**

    3. Running association analyses in GEMMA.

    4. Visualizing and interpreting the results of an association
       analysis.

Challenge #2: Prepare the data for GWAS
=======================================

+ Aim: Perform an exploratory analysis of the phenotype and covariate
  data, and prepare the data for association analysis with GEMMA.

+ Steps:

    1. Prepare genotype data for GEMMA.

    2. Import phenotype and covariate data into R.

    3. Explore phenotype and covariate data in R.

    4. Save phenotype and covariate data for GEMMA.

Prepare the genotype data for GEMMA
===================================

Processing the genotype data is more complicated, so I have provided
an R script to create, for each chromosome, a SNP annotation file and
a genotype file in the format used by GEMMA. Run the script in R:

```{bash convert-genotypes, eval=FALSE}
Rscript format.genotypes.for.gemma.R
```

This will take a few minutes to run.

> Instructor notes: What do the numeric values in file
> "chr01.geno.txt" represent?

Prepare the genotype data for GEMMA
===================================

The genotype data need to be combined into one file. This can be
easily done with the `cat` command, which combines by lines (rows):

```{bash merge-genotype-data, eval=FALSE}
cat chr*.geno.txt > geno.txt
```

We do the same for the SNP annotations:

```{bash merge-snp-data, eval=FALSE}
cat chr*.map.txt > map.txt
```

> Instructor notes: A natural question to ask is why didn't we combine
> the genotypes inside the R script.

Import phenotypes and covariates into R
=======================================

Start up R. On midway2, run:

```{bash start-R-2, eval=FALSE}
R --no-save
```

Before continuing, verify that your R working directory is set to the
"genetic-data-analysis-2" repository:

```{r check-wd-2}
getwd()
```

> Instructor notes: Before entering R, take a quick look at the
> phenotype and covariate data using simple command-line tools such as
> "less" and "wc".

Import phenotypes and covariates into R
=======================================

Load the phenotype and covariate data:

```{r load-pheno-data}
source("functions.R")
dat1 <- read.pheno("CFW_measures.txt")
dat2 <- read.pheno("CFW_covariates.txt")
```

Merge the two data frames, dropping the redundant "id" column:

```{r merge-pheno-data}
pheno <- cbind(dat1,dat2[-1])
```

Select samples
==============

We will use the same 1,934 samples that were used in the published
association analysis (Nicod *et al*, 2016). First, load the selected
sample ids:

```{r load-ids}
ids <-
  read.table("listof1934miceusedforanalysis.txt",
             stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
ids <- ids[[1]]
```

Next, select the rows of the phenotype table that match up with the
ids:

```{r select-ids}
rows  <- match(ids,pheno$Animal_ID)
pheno <- pheno[rows,]
```

Examine tibia length
====================

Take a closer look at the data for the phenotype of interest, tibia
length (units are "mm"):

```{r summarize-tibia-length}
summary(pheno$Tibia.Length)
```

Plot the distribution of tibia length:

```{r plot-tibia-length-dist}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_cowplot())
p1 <- ggplot(pheno,aes(Tibia.Length)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkblue",
                 na.rm = TRUE)
print(p1)
```

Examine tibia length vs. body weight
====================================

The study authors recommend using body weight as a covariate in the
association analysis (units are "g"). What do the data tell us about
the relationship between the two?

```{r summarize-body-weight}
summary(pheno$Weight.Diss)
```

Visualize the relationship between tibia length and body weight:

```{r plot-tibia-vs-weight}
p2 <- qplot(pheno$Weight.Diss,
            pheno$Tibia.Length,
            na.rm = TRUE)
print(p2)
```

> Instructor notes: tibia length and body weight appear to be
> correlated by looking at the plot. How can we quantify this in R?

Examine tibia length vs. sex
============================

The study authors also recommend using sex as a covariate in the
association analysis. Let's examine the data:

```{r summarize-sex}
pheno <- transform(pheno,Sex = factor(Sex))
summary(pheno$Sex)
```

A boxplot is a common way to visualize the relationship between a
continuous variable (tibia length) and a categorical variable (sex):

```{r plot-tibia-vs-sex}
p3 <- ggplot(pheno,aes(Sex,Tibia.Length)) +
      geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE)
print(p3)
```

Verify phenotype residuals
==========================

Compute the phenotypes after removing the linear effects of sex and
body weight:

```{r compute-residuals}
fit <- lm(Tibia.Length ~ Sex + Weight.Diss,pheno)
r   <- resid(fit)
```

Plot the distribution of the residuals:

```{r plot-residuals}
p4 <- ggplot(data.frame(resid = r),aes(resid)) +
      geom_histogram(color = "darkblue")
```

> Instructor notes: How could you assess a fit to normal distribution
> more rigorously?

Save phenotype data for GEMMA
=============================

Now that we have carefully examined the phenotype data, we are ready
to save the data in a format usable by GEMMA. First write the tibia
measurements to a new file, "pheno.txt":

```{r write-phenotype-data}
write.table(pheno$Tibia.Length,"pheno.txt",
            row.names = FALSE,
			col.names = FALSE)
```

> Instructor notes: Point out that GEMMA allows missing values (NA).

Save covariate data for GEMMA
=============================

Next, write the covariates (body weight and sex) to new file,
"covar.txt", in the format used by GEMMA. Sex needs to be encoded as a
number:

```{r write-covariate-data}
sex <- as.numeric(pheno$Sex) - 1
write.table(data.frame(1,sex,pheno$Weight.Diss),
            "covar.txt",sep = " ",
            row.names = FALSE,
            col.names = FALSE)
```

> Instructor notes: Why do we add a column of ones to the covariates
> file?

Preparing the phenotype data: take-home points
==============================================

Most analyses will involve:

+ Carefully checking phenotype and covariate data for possible
  issues, and resolving these issues (e.g., filtering out problematic
  samples, transforming phenotypes).

+ Reformatting the data.

In this tutorial, we performed these steps in R.

Preparing the genotype data: take-home points
=============================================

+ Typically, this is much more work (fortunately, the authors provided
  the processed genotype data).

+ A common mistake is to save the phenotype and genotype samples in
  different orders, which will lead to an incorrect association
  analysis!

Outline of workshop
===================

+ Preliminaries

+ Programming challenges:

    1. Setting up your environment for an association analysis.

    2. Preparing the data for an association analysis.

    3. **Running association analyses in GEMMA.**

    4. Visualizing and interpreting the results of an association
       analysis.

Challenge #3: Run association analyses
======================================

+ Aim: Compute *p*-values to assess support for association between
  tibia length and SNPs on chromosomes 1--19.

+ Steps:

    1. Run a basic association analysis in GEMMA.

    2. Run an LMM-based association analysis in GEMMA.

    3. Compare the two association analyses.

Basic association analysis in GEMMA
===================================

Now that we have installed GEMMA, and we have prepared the phenotype
and genotype data in the formats accepted by GEMMA, we are now ready
to run our first association analysis. 

```{bash gemma-lm, eval=FALSE}
./gemma -p pheno.txt -c covar.txt \
  -a map.txt -g geno.txt -notsnp \
  -lm 2 -outdir . -o tibia
```

This should take no more than a few minutes to complete.

> Instructor notes: The `-notsnp` option is included here to prevent
> any automatic processing of the genotype data.

Basic association analysis in GEMMA
===================================

This GEMMA call creates two files:

+ **tibia.log.txt:** A summary of the association analysis.

+ **tibia.assoc.txt:** The full table of association results
  (*p*-values, effect size estimates, *etc*).

LMM-based association analysis in GEMMA
=======================================

First, compute a kinship ("realized relatedness") matrix from the
genotypes.

```{bash gemma-kinship, eval=FALSE}
./gemma -p pheno.txt -g geno.txt \
  -a map.txt -gk 1 -outdir . -o tibia
```

Next, compute LMM-based association statistics for each SNP:

```{bash gemma-lmm, eval=FALSE}
./gemma -p pheno.txt -c covar.txt \
  -a map.txt -g geno.txt -notsnp \
  -k tibia.cXX.txt -lmm 2 -outdir . \
  -o tibia_lmm
```

LMM-based association analysis in GEMMA
=======================================

Since this may take an hour or more to complete, I have provided
files containing the outputs of these two GEMMA commands:

+ **tibia.cXX.txt.gz:** The 1,934 x 1,934 kinship matrix.

+ **tibia_lmm.log.txt:** A summary of the association analysis.

+ **tibia_lmm.assoc.txt.gz:** The full table of association results.

To use these files, you need to uncompress them first:

```{bash gemma-lmm-gunzip, eval=FALSE}
gunzip tibia.assoc.txt.gz
gunzip tibia_lmm.assoc.txt.gz
```

Compare basic and LMM association analyses
==========================================

The LMM is expected to reduce inflation of small *p*-values; a high
level of inflation could indicate many false positive associations.

+ The q-q plot is commonly used to assess inflation. This test is
  useful as a simple, heuristic diagnostic.

Launch R again, and import the results of the first GEMMA association
analysis:

```{r load-gemma-pvalues}
gwscan1 <- read.table("tibia.assoc.txt",
                      as.is = "rs",header = TRUE)
```

Compare basic and LMM association analyses
==========================================

Plot the observed *p*-values against the expected *p*-values under the
null distribution:

```{r plot-inflation-basic}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_cowplot())
source("functions.R")
p1 <- plot.inflation(gwscan1$p_lrt)
print(p1)
```

Next, we will compare this plot against the LMM q-q plot.

> Instructor notes: I recommend taking a screenshot of this plot.

Compare basic and LMM association analyses
==========================================

Follow the same steps as before to load the GEMMA results and create a
genomic inflation plot:

```{r plot-inflation-lmm}
gwscan2 <- read.table("tibia_lmm.assoc.txt",
                      as.is = "rs",header = TRUE)
p2 <- plot.inflation(gwscan2$p_lrt)
print(p2)
```

Compare against the previous inflation plot.

> Instructor notes: Did the LMM reduce inflation of p-values?

LMM-based association analysis: take-home points
================================================

+ LMMs are now one of the most widely used approaches to reduce
  inflation of false positive associations due to population structure
  and hidden relatedness.

+ LMMs can be computationally intensive, especially for data
  sets with many samples.

+ LMMs can *overcorrect* inflation. One remedy is the
  "leave-one-chromosome-out" (LOCO) approach.

Outline of workshop
===================

+ Preliminaries

+ Programming challenges:

    1. Setting up your environment for an association analysis.

    2. Preparing the data for an association analysis.

    3. Running association analyses in GEMMA.

    4. **Visualizing and interpreting the results of an association
       analysis.**

Challenge #4: Visualize and interpret results of association analysis
=====================================================================

+ Aim: Create plots to gain insight into the results of the
  association analysis.

+ Steps:

    1. Summarize "genome-wide" association signal for tibia length.

    2. Visualize strongest association signal.

    3. Based on the association signal, identify candidate genes.

    4. Visualize the relationship between tibia length and the
       top SNP association.

Plot genome-wide scan for tibia length
======================================

Using GEMMA, we computed association *p*-values at 353,697 SNPs on
chromosomes 1--19. Now let's plot these *p*-values to get a visual
summary of the association results. First, load the results of the LMM
association analysis:

```{r load-gemma-lmm-pvalues}
gwscan <- read.table("tibia_lmm.assoc.txt",
                     as.is = "rs",header = TRUE)
```

Plot genome-wide scan for tibia length
======================================

I wrote a function that uses `ggplot2` to create a "Manhattan plot"
showing the results of the association analysis.

```{r plot-gwscan}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_cowplot())
source("functions.R")
p1 <- plot.gwscan(gwscan)
print(p1)
```

This gives us a "genome-wide" view of the association signal.

Examine the association signal on chromosome 6
==============================================

Here we look more closely at the strongest association signal on
chromosome 6. First, create a data frame with the results for
chromosome 6 only:

```{r get-gwscan-chr6}
gwscan_chr6 <- subset(gwscan,chr == 6)
```

Next, plot the *p*-values against the base-pair position of the SNPs.

```{r plot-pvalues-chr6}
p2 <- plot.region.pvalues(gwscan_chr6)
print(p2)
```

Examine the association signal on chromosome 6
==============================================

It appears that the strongest association signal is isolated to
positions of 145 Mb and greater. Let's zoom in on that region:

```{r plot-pvalues-chr6-locus}
dat <- subset(gwscan_chr6,ps > 145e6)
p3 <- plot.region.pvalues(dat)
print(p3)
```

Let's find the SNP on chromosome 6 that is most strongly
associated with tibia length:

```{r top-marker}
i <- which.min(gwscan_chr6$p_lrt)
```

> Instructor notes: Use the UCSC Genome Browser
> (http://genome.ucsc.edu) to identify genes in or near the strongest
> association signal on chromosome 6 that may play a role in (tibia)
> bone development. For this, use NCBI release 38 (mm10) of the mouse
> genome assembly.

Visualize genotype-phenotype relationship
=========================================

Above, we identified the SNP that is most strongly associated with
tibia length.

+ Next, we examine the relationship between tibia length
  and the genotype at this SNP.

Load the GEMMA phenotype data:

```{r load-pheno-gemma}
pheno <- read.table("pheno.txt")
pheno <- pheno[[1]]
```

Visualize genotype-phenotype relationship
=========================================

Load the GEMMA genotype data for chromosome 6, and retrieve the
genotypes for the top SNP. To obtain discrete genotype values (0, 1,
2), round the numeric values to the nearest integer.

```{r load-geno-gemma}
library(data.table)
geno <- fread("chr06.geno.txt",sep = " ")
class(geno) <- "data.frame"
geno <- geno[,-(1:3)]
geno <- round(geno)
```

Visualize genotype-phenotype relationship
=========================================

If we convert the genotype to a "factor", we can visualize the
relationship with a boxplot.

```{r geno-num2factor}
geno_topsnp <- geno[i,]
geno_topsnp <- factor(geno_topsnp,0:2)
levels(geno_topsnp) <- c("GG","AG","AA")
```

A is the alternative allele, so a 2 corresponds to genotype "AA".

```{r plot-pheno-vs-geno}
pdat <- data.frame(pheno = pheno,
                   geno  = geno_topsnp)
p <- ggplot(pdat,aes(geno,pheno)) +
     geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE)
print(p)
```

This provides a visual summary of the genotype-phenotype relationship.
We can also *quantify* the relationship:

```{r lm-pheno-vs-geno}
fit <- lm(y ~ x,data.frame(x = geno_topsnp,
                           y = pheno))
summary(fit)
```

> Instructor notes: Observe that the "R-squared" is small. 

Recap
=====

+ We implemented the basic steps of a GWAS using GEMMA, R and
  command-line tools such as "cat".

+ We saw that much of the effort went into data processing and quality
  control.

+ We did not discuss how to determine an appropriate significance
  threshold. This is a complicated question. *My advice:* first take
  an exploratory approach to identify the strongest association
  signals, and determine significance later.
